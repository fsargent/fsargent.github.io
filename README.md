# Felix Sargent's Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, felixsargent.com. It's a static website built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Running Locally

To preview the website locally, you'll need to have Ruby and Bundler installed.

1.  **Install Jekyll and other dependencies:**

    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

2.  **Start the Jekyll server:**
    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
    ```

This will start a local server at `http://localhost:4000`. Any changes you make to the files will automatically reload the page.
