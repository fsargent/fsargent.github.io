    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a seasoned engineering leader with a passion for building high-performing teams and scalable, robust software. With over a decade of experience spanning from individual contributor to Head of Engineering, I've honed my skills in Scala, Typescript, and Python, with a deep appreciation for type safety, observability, and comprehensive testing.

    <p>
        Outside of my professional life, I'm deeply passionate about improving democratic systems. As the former chair of the <a href="https://electionscience.org">Center for Election Science</a>, I've dedicated years to advocating for better voting methods. My writing on this topic, as well as on software engineering, reflects my commitment to solving complex problems and fostering positive change.

        Want to chat? Happy to hop on a call, or better, let's get a coffee in London. I ask for a $50 donation to the <a href="https://electionscience.org">Center for Election Science</a> for a <a href="https://tidycal.com/felix.sargent">30 minute chat</a>. I'm available for speaking events on social choice theory, and mentoring in engineering management.
