    <h2>Spiced Ginger Beer</h2>
    <p><em>August 12, 2014</em></p>
    <p>I love Ginger Beer. My family has a long history of making it. Granddad used to make ginger beer with a culture of Ginger Beer Plant in England. It must be in the blood.</p>
    <p>I’ve tried making it a ton of ways now. Fermenting it, adjusting flavors, frying the ginger before hand. Drying it, then boiling it. Mostly too much work with few benefits. Here’s a quick recipe to make a batch of Ginger Syrup you can mix with Soda Water whenever you like.</p>
    <p><strong>Ginger Beer Syrup:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>1/2lb Ginger</li>
    <li>1 Cup sugar</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon Molasses (or just use 1 1/2 cup brown sugar -for total)</li>
    <li>4 Cups Water (1 Liter)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Spices (in a spice bag)</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>1 Cinnamon Stick</li>
    <li>2 Star Anise</li>
    <li>4 All Spice Berries</li>
    <li>4 Cloves</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon of Cayenne Pepper (seriously.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Chop the ginger, then put sugar, ginger, water, molasses into water and take to a boil/simmer. It can go on for as long as you like, so leave it simmering with the lid on. Put the spices into a little cheesecloth bag, tie it off, throw it in there too. After about 10 minutes you can stop it. Let it cool, and then put it into bottles. Done.</p>
    <p>The trick is to make it how you like it. Keep tasting it as you include new things. Play with the ingredients. The only thing I wouldn’t get rid of is the Cayenne pepper because of the amazing way it takes the initial gingery spice and lengthens it out. The long subtle spice makes it luxurious.</p>
    <p>When you’re ready to drink it, go 4:1 Soda Water:Syrup. Tastes great with flat water too.</p>
    <p><strong>What happened to fermenting it?</strong><br>
    It was a fun experiment, but I found it took far too long. The bubbles were fun, having all that brewing equipment around my house was not. This was before I spiced the Ginger Beer, and was looking to get that same spicy hot flavor you find in Reed’s ginger ale. Fermentation didn’t noticeably change the flavor, except when it went horribly wrong.</p>
