    <h2>Get your CA Vaccine Pass into Apple Wallet</h2>
    <p><em>August 13, 2021</em></p>
    <p>I went to the effort to print out my Vaccine QR code, but hang on, isn’t this 2021? Let’s put this into Apple Wallet.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 0: Get your vaccine!</li>
        <li>Get your <a href="https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/">Vaccine QR Code</a></li>
        <li>Download <a href="https://www.pass2u.net/">Pass2U Wallet</a> from the App Store</li>
        <li>In Pass2U Wallet, click the Hamburger menu, select “Pass Store”, Select the “Popular” tab, then search for “Vaccine” and select the CA Digital COVID record.</li>
        <li>You’ll be asked to fill out your details, and scan your QR code. Pass2U will likely ask you for $2. I think it’s worth it.</li>
    </ol>
