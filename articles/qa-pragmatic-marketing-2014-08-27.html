            <p><em>Felix Sargent started his career as a developer and now works at Rackspace as a product manager</em></p>
            <p><strong>How did you become a product manager?</strong><br>
            During one development project, I was the person who ended up facilitating the discussions about what to build and the kind of work that entailed. I worked to create consensus and made sure everyone’s opinions were heard. Afterward, my manager asked me if I wanted to be the product manager. Strangely, I wanted to be a product manager since I was young. My brother, who is 11 years older, moved from England to America to be a software engineer when he was 21. I grew up listening to his horror stories: “I built out this new feature that allows them to release new updates without ever having any downtime and nobody really noticed.” I wanted to be the product manager he never had. That’s molded my personality as I’ve worked.</p>
            <p><strong>Do you fill the role the way you dreamed about back then?</strong><br>
            I love my job and have a passion for doing it, but you would have to ask my teammates what they think about working with me. I think my experience as a developer is really useful, because I can communicate and speak that language. Part of my philosophy as a product manager is that I don’t believe in strict adherence to process, except to provide stability so people know what to do next. When I read the “top 10 ways to organize your backlog,” I think the author is missing the point by not talking to the people and finding out what’s driving them crazy — and then figuring out ways to address those issues.</p>
            <p><strong>Do you and your brother talk shop wHen you get together?</strong><br>
            We wouldn’t work together, because we’d kill each other. But it’s always nice to both complain and learn from each other. He allows me to hear things from a different perspective, and it’s nice to bounce things off each other for feedback.</p>
            <p><strong>Do you ever miss being a developer?</strong><br>
            The nice thing about being a developer is that you know when you’re done. As a software engineer, you just get into a state where you know you’re going to squash a bug and fix things and they’re going to be more perfect. I’ve seen many of my product-management peers become incredibly overworked, because they aim for perfection and don’t know where to stop. There is no such thing as perfection when you’re looking through the backlog. Figuring out what to work on and what not to work on is always a challenging task. It’s impossible to perfect a plan before things change.</p>
            <p><strong>Do you have any advice for anyone who wants to move from development to product management?</strong><br>
            You should prepare for “being busy” to be different. As a software developer, it means you’re always developing. Being busy as a product manager is like being busy as a parent. It comes down to being ready, not about fighting fires. Instead of setting the direction, being a good product manager is really about listening to the direction as others perceive it — and then putting that into a document that can be shared to create a touchstone. You’re codifying the zeitgeist of what the team is doing and what the team needs to work on in the future. In order to do that, you need to be listening.<br>
            I think the best place to start is to know what a bad product manager is. It’s much easier to define than a good one. A bad product manager says, “Do this.” A good product manager says, What do you need me to do?”<br>
            Managing well is like dancing well. There isn’t a series of steps you follow and then you’re done. You need to interact and relate to your partner and environment.</p>
            <p><strong>Do you have any advice for a new product manager?</strong><br>
            Put the kettle on and have some tea. Meetings are often painful, forced, time-boxed, stressful and aggravating. At first, my team and I were doing agile standup meetings, where there’s a time limit, which makes people feel too uncomfortable to discuss much. Developers are only talking about what they’re doing next so that people are on the same page. But being on the same page doesn’t always help. You also need to have a forum where people are relaxed and safe, so they can say if they don’t like something — and see if others are feeling the same way.<br>
            One afternoon, after a morning full of handling my team’s issues, one of my engineers came to me with yet another request.Admittedly, my brain was fried at the time and I needed a reset. I’m English, so 3 p.m. is tea time for me and I find good tea to be both calming and invigorating. It helps clear my mind and set me on a productive path for the rest of the afternoon. I invited my engineer to join me for a pot of tea, and we started discussing the issue he’d brought to my attention.<br>
            We moved from our company kitchen to a set of comfortable couches and talked candidly about the issues. Others wandered over, listened in, aired their own opinions and started solving problems themselves. I poured more tea and put on another pot. As they talked, I found myself hearing them in a new light and finding opportunities where I could make their work easier for them. Sometimes, it was as simple as clarifying priorities and helping them understand deadlines. Other times, it meant working with others in our organization to better use APIs or integrate code. For us, the key to a good standup meeting was sitting down.</p>
