    <h2>A Bank Near You</h2>
    <p><em>April 8, 2014</em></p>
    <p>How Code for America’s San Francisco Brigade helped SF residents find financial stability</p>
    <p>In 2013, Code for America hosted Code Across America, inviting San Francisco Government Agencies to come out and collaborate with volunteers on civic problems. I jumped at the chance to do something for the community with my skills. I met up with Marc Chung, an engineer at Lookout Mobile Security to find a project.</p>
    <p>Imagine you’ve found your way to San Francisco, stayed with friends, and got back on your feet from a rocky time. Bounced checks, bad credit, but you’re ready to start anew. Except now banks won’t let you open an account, nor cash your paycheck. Where would you turn?</p>
    <p>Officials of the City and County of San Francisco looked into the number of households in the city living without a checking or savings account. The researchers found about 50,000 households without any form of bank account. That figure included approximately half of San Francisco’s adult African-Americans and Latinos.</p>
    <p>The San Francisco Office of Financial Empowerment (SFOFE) BankOn Program was created to help the unbanked get accounts at partner institutions in and around San Francisco. A registry of participating institutions is the key to this service. Unfortunately, the _40 page PDF registry_ is difficult for its customers to use. Kristina Ng from the SFOFE knew that San Francisco could do better for its citizens.</p>
    <p>Kristina wanted a way we could display these partner banks through a Google map. Marc Chung and I jumped at the chance, and we got to work.</p>
    <p>The new site is an easy to use Google map with filters showing the location of partner banks. It integrates into the existing website, and does not place a burden on SF Government IT. How can we store the records of the system, but not host anything? We use Google Fusion Tables to act as a database, and query it with Client Side JavaScript. We edited the existing Wordpress page, and over the next few weeks integrated the new map, filters and pins. This is the outcome</p>
    <p>With the combined effort of the San Francisco Brigade and the San Francisco Office of Financial Empowerment citizens of San Francisco can find financial independence where they couldn’t before.</p>
    <p>This is only the start. There are many more directories that we can map. It’s still too hard to find childcare services, apply for parking permits, or start a new business. The San Francisco Brigade is working to solve all these problems. It’s time to get involved. Join us.</p>
